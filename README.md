# Improving Geochemical Calculation in RTM with Machine Learning Models
# Abstract
Reactive transport numerical modeling is crucial for understanding how fluids and solids interact chemically in diverse subsurface processes. Its importance has surged due to applications like carbon capture storage, contaminant dispersion, and mineralization. However, modeling chemical reactions is computationally demanding, especially for complex systems, often dominating simulation costs. This paper explores using machine learning models to replace traditional geochemical modules in porous media reactive transport simulations. Reactive transport simulations often involve extensive geochemical calculations, such as those performed by PHREEQC, which can be time-consuming. This project investigates the feasibility of substituting these computationally intensive processes with machine learning models. By employing techniques like Monte Carlo simulations and Latin hypercube sampling for dataset generation, we explore how machine learning models can accurately predict the outcomes of these geochemical calculations in a fraction of the time. This approach shows promise in significantly reducing the computational cost associated with reactive transport simulations.
